- load dictionary

- compute cost for each word

- find length  of the longest word in the dictionary
    -> maxword = 6  # a smaller sample space

- build a cost array
    -> cost = [0]  # initial value

    - loop in range of len(string)
        -> string = "thepeople"
        -> length = 9
        -> loop range = 1 to 10  # starting from index 1 as 0th value is initialized

        - call best match finder
            -> args = current index, string
            -> find range to pick values from cost array
                -> start = max(0, i - maxword)
                -> end = current index
