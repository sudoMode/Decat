***Decat*** is a light-weight Python package capable of de-concatenating strings that do 
not have white-spaces in them, or in other words, it allows the user to infer spaces 
programmatically. This is a simple utility that comes in handy with various modern Natural Language Processing(NLP) tasks such as cleaning, exploration or even manipulation of text. [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) is at the core of this project, aim is to provide an easy interface for programmers to extract meaningful information out of deformed pieces of texts.
